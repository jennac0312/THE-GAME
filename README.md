# COLOR BUSTER
    the brain game

How does your brain react when presented with conflicting information?
Can you ignore instinct in pursuit of a logical path? 
Step inside Color Buster to confront the limits of your own perception.

### How To Play
The concept of the game is the same across all modes: Resist your instinct

Begin by selecting 1 of 4 modes.
Easy mode is based on the Stroop Effect expirements. You are presented with a named color that is written in another color. Your mission is to choose the color of the word.

The hard mode is my interpretation of the Stroop Effect and loosely inspired by a TikTok color game.
Your mission is to choose the color of the written word.

Arcade mode and Speed mode are common game styles I decided to implement.

### Road Blocks
One night, I jumped up from bed and realized I coded my entire game wrong! The logic was backwards for the easy mode. Luckily, since I implemented OOP principles the fix was simple. After editing a few lines of code, Color Buster was back in business. 

### Features
Use of local storage to track game history.
Instant feedback after each question with a green or red flash.

### Future Improvements
Better UI ...
