# COLOR BUSTER
    the brain game

How does your brain react when presented with conflicting information?
Can you ignore instinct in pursuit of a logical path?

    
Step inside Color Buster to confront the limits of your own perception.

### How To Play
Begin by selecting 1 of 4 modes. 
The concept of the game is the same across all modes. 
    Resist your instinct
Easy mode is based on the Stroop Effect expirements. You are presented with a named color that is written in another color. Your mission is to choose the color of the word. 

The other modes (hard, speed, and arcade) are my interpretation of the Stroop Effect
